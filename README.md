**Practical-1 : Autoencoders** properly in the hierarchy form :

* **Field** → **Machine Learning (ML)**
* **Subfield** → **Deep Learning (DL)** (because they use neural networks with multiple layers)
* **Category** → **Unsupervised Learning** (since they learn patterns from data without labels)
* **Technique** → **Representation Learning / Dimensionality Reduction** (they learn compressed, meaningful features from data)

> Autoencoders are a **deep learning technique under unsupervised learning** that aim to **compress data into a lower-dimensional representation (encoding) and then reconstruct it back (decoding)**. They are mainly used for **feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, noise removal, and generative tasks**.

**Practical-2 : Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in Hierarchy

**Field → Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
**Subfield → Machine Learning (ML)**
**Branch → Deep Learning (DL)** (modern NLP relies heavily on neural networks, especially transformers)
**Domain → Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
**Category → Text Understanding & Generation**
**Technique → Transformer-based Models (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT, GPT, etc.)**

**What NLP is**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a domain of AI that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between computers and human communication by processing unstructured text and speech data.

**What I Did (Sentiment Analysis)**

* We used **Hugging Face Transformers** to build a **sentiment analysis pipeline**.
* Model used: **DistilBERT fine-tuned on SST-2 dataset** (binary classification: Positive / Negative).
* Input: A text sentence.
* Output:- The sentiment label (Positive/Negative) + Confidence Score.

**Why I Did This**

* **To demonstrate NLP in action**: showing how a pre-trained model can quickly classify text sentiment.
* **Hands-on with Transformers**: exploring Hugging Face’s pipeline for easy inference.
* **Practical use-case**: Sentiment analysis is widely used in product reviews, customer feedback, and social media monitoring.

**Final Conclusion**

This experiment helped me understand how **NLP models like BERT/DistilBERT work for real-world text tasks**. By using a simple pipeline, I saw how transfer learning allows models trained on large datasets to be applied to our own sentences with minimal effort. This lays the foundation for exploring more advanced NLP tasks like text summarization, question answering, and chatbots.

**Practical-3 : LLM Core Demo – Text Generation with GPT-2**

**Objective**
Demonstrate the core idea of **Large Language Models (LLMs): predicting the next word**.  

**Core Idea**

LLMs like GPT-2 are essentially **next-word predictors** trained on massive text corpora.
They generate text step by step, producing human-like sentences.

**Conclusion**

**This experiment demonstrates the core working principle of Large Language Models (LLMs):**

LLMs like GPT-2 are trained on huge text datasets.Their goal is not to "understand" language in a human way, but to predict the most probable next word (token) based on the input sequence.By repeating this prediction step many times, they generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences.The experiment shows how the same model behaves differently depending on the starting prompt.For example, with “Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world because…”, GPT-2 completes the thought in a logical way, whereas with “In 2050, humans and machines will…”, it predicts a futuristic continuation.

**Practical-4 : Neural Network for Non-Linear Patterns**

**1. The Problem**

* Traditional **Linear Regression** can only draw a *straight line* through data.
* But many real-world problems (like predicting weather, stock trends, human behavior, speech, or language) are **non-linear** (curvy, wavy, irregular).

**Example:**
Here we use a **sine wave** (`y = sin(x)`) as the dataset → it’s **non-linear**.

**Why Sine Wave?**
The sine wave (y = sin(x)) is a classic non-linear function.If you try to fit a straight line (linear regression), **it will completely fail because the curve goes up and down**.this makes it a perfect test case to show **why we need neural networks instead of simple linear models**.

**2. The Neural Network**

I used `MLPRegressor` (Multi-Layer Perceptron) → this is a simple **feedforward neural network**.
* `hidden_layer_sizes=(10,10)` → two hidden layers, each with 10 neurons.
* Each layer transforms the input, applying **non-linear activation functions**.
* The network learns how to bend and curve the prediction line to match the sine wave.
  
**3. The Learning Process**
1. Input `X` (numbers from -3 to 3).
2. Network passes them through layers of neurons.
3. Uses **backpropagation** to adjust weights to minimize error between predicted `y_pred` and actual `y`.
4. After training, the red curve tries to match the blue sine curve.

**Conclusion:**

* **Linear models** (like regression) can only capture *straight-line relationships*.
* **Neural networks** can capture **non-linear and complex patterns** because they stack layers and use non-linear activations.
* This makes them powerful for tasks like image recognition, speech, and language understanding → where relationships aren’t simple lines but complex curves.
**Key takeaway:** Neural networks **generalize beyond straight lines** → they can approximate *any function* given enough layers and neurons (this is called the **Universal Approximation Theorem**).

**Practical-5 : Core CNN Objective**

**Objective**
- Learn spatial patterns **(edges → curves → shapes → objects)**.
- Use convolutions + pooling to **reduce complexity** and focus on **important features**.

**Conclusion:**

CNNs automatically learn **spatial features** from images:
* **Convolution layers** detect simple patterns like edges and curves.
* **Pooling layers** reduce complexity while keeping important info.
* **Deeper layers** combine features to recognize complex shapes (like digits).

**Core Objective:**
Unlike traditional ML where features are hand-engineered, **CNNs learn features directly from raw data** → making them highly effective for computer vision tasks (MNIST accuracy **\~98%**).

**Practical-6 : Text Classification with an RNN (LSTM)**

**Objective**
- Show how AI understands and classifies sequences of words.

**Core Objective:**
- Embedding layer → turns words into dense vectors (word meaning).
- LSTM → remembers sequence context (not just words but order).
- Model reaches ~87–90% accuracy on movie review sentiment classification.

**Conclusion:**

LSTM-based text classification shows how AI captures meaning from sequences. Instead of treating words as independent, the model learns context and order, enabling accurate predictions (positive/negative sentiment). This demonstrates the core NLP objective: making machines understand human language.

**Practical-7 : Clustering with K-Means (Iris Dataset)**

**Objective**

* Show how AI can discover hidden groups in data without labels.

**Core Objective:**

* K-Means groups data based on **similarity (distance)**.
* PCA reduces high-dimensional data into 2D for visualization.
* Centroids represent the “center” of each discovered cluster.

**Conclusion:**
K-Means clustering demonstrates the power of **unsupervised learning**. Even without labels, the algorithm successfully finds natural groups in the Iris dataset. This highlights the **core ML objective** of discovering structure and patterns in raw data.
